HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIM FRAUDS IDENTIFICATION



The primary objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated machine learning model designed to accurately detect fraudulent insurance claims. By analyzing historical insurance data, including claim amounts, claimant demographics, and other relevant attributes, the model will identify patterns and anomalies indicative of fraud. This approach seeks to improve the efficiency of claim processing while safeguarding against fraudulent activities.

    Healthcare is considered as one of the complex industry and it’s especially need in this pandemic period. Many people are getting infected in this pandemic period and everyone can’t afford payment. In this time insurance comes handy for the people to reduce their financial burden. But there are frauds happening in this also so it is very difficult and some may not get proper response due to this. So there is a need to address this problem. Machine learning is mainly used to tackle these issues so we will be a building a machine learning model where the model is made to train on the previous data and made to learn to find the pattern so that it is capable of analyising and prediction the insurance claim is fraud or not.

	Machine learning algorithms takes less time and computational power than the existing system methods. 
	As the system can be automated it will be helpful to healthcare industry to serve the people.
